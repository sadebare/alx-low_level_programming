[5-island_perimeter.py](./5-island_perimeter.py)    |   Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid: <br> grid is a list of list of integers:<br>- 0 represents a water zone <br> -    1 represents a land zone <br>-  One cell is a square with side length 1 <br>-   Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).<br>- Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100<br>- Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).<br>-  The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water around the island).
